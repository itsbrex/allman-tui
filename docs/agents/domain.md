# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

**Layout: single-context.** One `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root, ADRs in `docs/adr/`.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (most repos):

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│   └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root):

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
└── src/
    ├── ordering/
    │   ├── CONTEXT.md
    │   └── docs/adr/                  ← context-specific decisions
    └── billing/
        ├── CONTEXT.md
        └── docs/adr/
```

## The companion CLI's docs are in scope

Most of the domain — identity spaces, the store layout, throttles and quotas, the two LinkedIn
backends — is defined in `allman-cli`, not here. This repo's `CONTEXT.md` covers the TUI's own
vocabulary (modes, panes, the binary/store resolution rules) and defers to the CLI for the rest.

When a question is about what the data *means*, read `allman-cli`'s `CONTEXT.md` and `CLAUDE.md` in
the sibling checkout. Don't redefine a CLI term here in different words — a second, drifting
definition is worse than a pointer.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_

## Relationship to `CLAUDE.md`

`CLAUDE.md` holds the operational rules — stack, commands, critical patterns, endpoint quirks.
`CONTEXT.md` holds the **vocabulary**: what a term means and which synonyms to avoid.
When the two disagree about a fact, `CLAUDE.md` wins and `CONTEXT.md` gets corrected.
