# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.

These labels exist on the fork, `itsbrex/allman-tui`, only. Upstream `tarkaai/allman-tui` carries
just GitHub's default label set and we have no push access to add to it, so **`/triage` runs
against the fork only** — see `issue-tracker.md`. Adopt an upstream ticket into a fork issue rather
than trying to label it in place.

The same five labels exist on `itsbrex/allman-cli`, with the same meanings, so a ticket that turns
out to belong to the CLI keeps its triage state when it moves.

## Wayfinder labels

`/wayfinder` also needs these to exist. `gh issue create --label <missing>` fails outright rather
than creating the label, so they are created up front:

`wayfinder:map`, `wayfinder:research`, `wayfinder:prototype`, `wayfinder:grilling`, `wayfinder:task`
